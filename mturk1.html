        The goal of this task is to identify the # of visible faces in the picture.
        <br></br>
        <b>
            A visible face is defined (for the purposes of this task) as a head which is contained fully within the area of the image.<br></br>
            Someone whose face is partially covered by another person counts, but someone who is at the edge and only has half their head in the picture does not.
